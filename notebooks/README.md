# Notebooks

This directory is supposed to hold all the notebooks used during the development of a Data Science project.

The use of Jupyter Notebooks is nowadays a *de-facto* standard in many areas of Data Science: the existence of this directory aims at removing the choice between a deployable software solution and an exploratory notebook solution.
A Data Science project should be made of both in order to be insightful, repeatable and deployable in a production environment.
